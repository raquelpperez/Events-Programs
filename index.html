        Join us on Friday April 7 at 6pm for an Environmental Justice/Activism Listening Session at The Discovery Center! Hosted by Amani Reid, Policy Specialist for PA Interfaith Power and Light, and Audubon Mid-Atlantic.
        The theme will be Environmental Justice and Activism. This will be an evening to learn, explore, and focus on ways we can get involved and volunteer locally on environmental issues affecting their community like pollution, housing, utilities and more! We will also provide journals to use in discussion as well as when you are exploring the space.
        Refreshments will be provided. We will start the event off with a poem and nature walk led by Audubon Mid-Atlantic!

    Join Audubon Mid-Atlantic plant expert Jose Santiago as we walk you through the ins and outs of growing native plants. You don't need a yard, or a ton of space to grow beautiful, and beneficial, native plants. 
    All you need is a windowsill, a patio, or even a stoop. This workshop is designed to teach you about caring for plants in your home, discuss the benefits of native plants in your community, and even get a free plant to take home. No previous gardening experience necessary! 
    Great for the whole family. This workshop will include a small hike in our front pollinator garden and the beginning of our nature trail. All equipment needed for the workshop will be provided.</p>
